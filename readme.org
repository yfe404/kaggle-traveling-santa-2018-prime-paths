** Best Approach so far 

What worked the best up until now was the TSP Solver (cf [[file:tsp_solver]]).

I tried various other approches: Greedy, GAs, Random Search, the tsp solver outperformed all of them
by far.


It seems that there is a positive correlation between the running time of the solver and the 
score of the solutions generated. 


We should consider building a distributed pipeline in which we would have several instances of TSP
generating solutions used as input in other algorithms such as local search.
